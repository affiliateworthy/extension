 Here are step-by-step instructions for non-technical users on how to install a Chrome extension manually:

Download the extension files:
If the extension is provided as a ZIP file, extract the contents to a folder on your computer.

Open Google Chrome:
Make sure you have Google Chrome installed on your computer. If not, you can download and install it from the official Google Chrome website (https://www.google.com/chrome/).

Access the Extensions page:
In Google Chrome, click on the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner of the browser window and select "More tools" > "Extensions" from the drop-down menu.

Enable Developer mode:
In the Extensions page, look for the "Developer mode" toggle switch in the top-right corner of the page and enable it by clicking on it. This will enable the ability to manually install extensions.

Load the extension:
Click on the "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer mode. This will open a file dialog box. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files (or the folder that contains the extension files) and select it. Then click on the "Open" button.

Confirm installation:
The extension should now be loaded in Chrome, and you should see its icon in the Extensions toolbar. A popup might also appear asking you to confirm the installation of the extension. Click on the "Add extension" or "Yes" button to confirm.

Access the extension:
You can now access the extension by clicking on its icon in the Extensions toolbar. The extension's functionality, such as displaying HTML code in a popup, should now be available for use.
